Bregonig.dll is a regular expression library compatible with bregexp.dll.
Bregexp.dll was widely used in Japanese Win32 applications, but the regexp
engine was very old. (It seems to be a modified version of Perl 5.00x.)
On the other hand, bregonig.dll uses Oniguruma (or Onigmo) to support
more powerful regexp patterns.
